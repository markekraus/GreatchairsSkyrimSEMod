## User Guide

Greatchairs can be crafted at a blacksmith's forge using the same materials as normal greatswords of the same type. They can also be upgraded at grindstones.

Greatchairs are equipped like normal greatswords and are used the same as well.

Greatchairs can also be bought from blacksmiths and any other vendors that normally sell greatswords.

Enemies may also be armed with Greatchairs. They may attack you with them or you may find them on their dead bodies.

Greatchairs may also be found in chests.

## Compatibility

This mod should be compatible with everything.

This mod has scripted compatibility with [Valdacil's Item Sorting](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5224). No patch is required.

## Warning: Not Lore-friendly

This mod is technically not lore-friendly because chair weapons are silly.
